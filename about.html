        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <h2>Authors: Lauren Sampson, Jing Li, Yujia Shi</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center; margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
            This project is inspired by the sheer universality of death. 
            Despite death being a fate that everyone eventually shares, 
            the way people die can provide a lot of insight about their 
            lives—specifically their socio-economic status and location 
            they lived in. Our goal for this website is to tell a story 
            of the rate at which people die in different places and why 
            that is. Hopefully, we can help show which countries need to 
            work on various elements of their citizens lifestyles that 
            might in fact contribute to the death factor.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center; margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
            The data we found is supported by 
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmadjalalmasood123/deaths-by-risk-factor-dataset">
                Kaggle
            </a> 
            and is representative of 228 entities or locations and 28 
            different death factors. We decided to split them up based 
            on similarity in factor (e.g. we have a bubble that breaks 
            down the different environmental causes of death). By 
            illustrating all of these factors in various visualizations, 
            we hope to show users in many different formats, what the 
            leading cause of death is in various locations.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center; margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
            Users should be able to select the death factor they want to 
            look at and view visualizations as they scroll accordingly. 
            First they will encounter a choropleth world map that operates 
            where the color gradient correlates to the number of deaths. Then 
            the user will be able to see a bar chart the numerically displays 
            the top ten countries that contribute to that factor’s rate. The 
            scatter plot indicates a correlation between the continents GDP 
            and death rates — we wanted users to be able to associate the 
            socio-economic factors that go into a locations either high or 
            low death rates.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center; margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">
            Overall, we wanted to make this a story about death rates and how 
            they affect everyone on earth's lives. We looked at the ways 
            location plays into death rate as well as GDP and overall continental 
            averages. We hope you enjoy the website and feel free to reach out 
            with any further questions.
